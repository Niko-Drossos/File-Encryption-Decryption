Before you use the script you will need to install python on the host machine,
the first time you run Encrypt.py it will start installing cryptograghy.Fernet and tkinter.
Just run the script a second time after it finishes installing for it to work

!!WARNING!!
DO NOT LOSE THE KEYS, if you lose the keys to the encryption, you WILL LOSE THE FILES.
DO NOT CHANGE FOLDER PATHS OF ENCRYPTED FILES, this script works by saving the path of the selected folder,
so if you change the path the script wont be able to find the folder.
Do not change the files paths within the app.


recommended use case,
Move files to a USB drive so you can keep the keys somewhere safe.
Or you can start the startApp.bat a shortcut on desktop and keep the software on your computer.
Try to keep encryptions relatively small to minimize the chance of failure.
Make sure to have a backup when you encrypt files.


To Encrypt,
Start startApp.bat and press "E" to start Encrypt.py
Select folder from the file explorer and the files inside the folder will start encrypting.
This only is able to encrypt files inside folders, it will itterate over all files and dirs inside the selected folder.
It will then list all the files that have been encrypted.


To Decrypt,
Start startApp.bat and press "D" to start Decrypt.py
A CMD prompt will pop up asking you to input the coresponding number to the folder you decrypted.
It will then list all the files that have been decrypted.
press enter and you're done
